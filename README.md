# Spida

Spida is a 2D game in which you need to kill as many flies as possible without dying. Flies do 10 damage every 0.5 seconds if you are touching them, but they will die after 2 seconds of touching the net. You can spawn the net by holding down space and moving around with WASD or the arrow keys. The net will despawn after a while, so be carefull how much you place and how long it takes you to place!
